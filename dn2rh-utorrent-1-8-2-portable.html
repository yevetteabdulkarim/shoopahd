I would like to switch to Qbittorrent. But i also hate how utorrent and Qbit save everything in appdata. I tried the one from portable apps and i think it still sets everything in the windows user dir. At least i saw some files put there after opening it :/ I recently figured out how to make utorrent 2.1.1 portable and save everything in one dir. But after using Qbit  i'd like to use it instead if i can. Any help? EDIT: I did some further testing and it does save files in the windows. –ó–¥–µ—Å—å —Å–æ–±—Ä–∞–Ω –∞—Ä—Ö–∏–≤ —Å—Ç–∞—Ä—ã—Ö –≤–µ—Ä—Å–∏–π –ø—Ä–æ–≥—Ä–∞–º–º—ã uTorrent, –Ω–∞—á–∏–Ω–∞—è —Å uTorrent 1.1.3, –≤—ã–ø—É—â–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–π 02 –æ–∫—Ç—è–±—Ä—è 2005 –≥–æ–¥–∞.

I'm selling off my good old Inspiron 15 for college. It's a pretty good computer, but it weighs 6 pounds and now I need something that'll easily slide into a backpack. In 2016 I had an internship where I was given a Mac Air (not sure about its specs), and while it sometimes slowed down, it generally had a great feel for just coding and getting work done. Using it was intuitive and at some times fun. For me, it was harder to get distracted working with it compared to the the Inspiron. –ï—Å–ª–∏ —É –≤–∞—Å –≤–æ–∑–Ω–∏–∫–ª–∏ –ø—Ä–æ–±–ª–µ–º—ã —Å –∑–∞–≥—Ä—É–∑–∫–æ–π (—Å—Å—ã–ª–∫–∞ –Ω–µ —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–∞–µ—Ç), —Å–æ–æ–±—â–∏—Ç–µ –Ω–∞–º –æ–± —ç—Ç–æ–º, —É–∫–∞–∑–∞–≤ –ø–æ–¥—Ä–æ–±–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ –Ω–∏–∂–µ.

I've found the 64gb version at a very reasonable price. However, upon investigation, I've discovered that the free disk space available is around 34gb. My needs are relatively basic; my main use for the device will be pdf reading and word processing.

I downloaded uTorrent 3.5.0 build 43916 (the latest at the time of this post), and it appears to be an installer that always elevates, so it cannot be used to run uTorrent in portable mode.

If you want to skip straight to the solution, please scroll down a little bit. After restarting my Windows torrent box, I noticed something strange. My uTorrent 2.2.1 client showed that some of my torrents were showing their "Added On" and "Completed On" dates to be in the future. Screenshot ( For reference, today's date is 11/28/2016. Other people on forums report that this happens when they restart as well. Perhaps it has something to do with uTorrent.

At the moment I will be using it for work (light office stuff, but needs to be portable), content consumption (web, reading, video, music, etc.) and maybe ultra light gaming (Civilization V/VI). Maybe some light use of Adobe Lightroom or Photoshop. Next year I'll start attending college and I will need to use it also for note taking in class, working on projects (will study electrical eng.) and more of what I'm doing right.

I would like to find out more about portable apps, especially from portableapps.com. I am using Windows 10 Pro 64 bit version now. How does it generally work? Can you make applications portable so easily? Would it be beneficial to do so with some that are used rarely few times over few months ? Can applications like Pro version of uTorrent or CCleaner be made portable? Does it leave behind log files, registry or other weird things that sort of clog your OS? Kind regards.
